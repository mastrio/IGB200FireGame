<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Counter Fire is a student developed project for the IGB200 assesment submission for the DES project brief. This is the first prototype which is still lacking animations and a second scenario but features majority of the key fire mechanics. 


The project is being developed by 

- Andrew Seton: Project Managment, Assest Moddeler, Assest Managemnt, Level Development<sub>temp</sub>
- Connor Samra-Dardis: Core Mechanics Programming, Game Design, Ui Mechanics Support* ,Level Development<sub>temp</sub>
- Hayden Clark: Ui Development, Game Design, Ui Programming, Level Development<sub>temp</sub>
- Charlie Bui: UX Research, Level Terrain

temp = temporary role for prototype

### Built With

The Project was developed with Unity 6 (6000.0.040f1LTS) and a Github repositery version control. Google Docs was used for the Game Design Doccumentation and GoogleSheets for Project/Sprint Managment.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mastrio/IGB200FireGame.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin mastrio/IGB200FireGame
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [] Player Pathfinding Movement - Feature 1
- [] Score System - Feature 2
- [] Weather System - Feature 3
- [] Wildfire Scenario - Feature 4
    - [ ] Nested Feature

These are some of the key features that were unable to be implmented prior to prototype submission. Further planned features are outlined within the Game Design Documentation as well as a full write up of the intended features implmentation and functionality.

There are also known issues with the Fire Danger rating and drawing users attention to the phone promot when the fire danger rating updates. This build is still an early prototype so the fire intensity growthrate variables and mechanics still need to be finetuned based off playertesting feedback.
