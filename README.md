<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Counter Fire is a student developed project for the IGB200 assesment submission for the DES project brief. 
This is the first prototype which is still lacking animations and a second scenario but features majority of the key fire mechanics. 

It is developed with a future port to iPad systems, so the movement and interaction systems were designed with this basis. 
As such click to move and interact was decided as this can mimic touch inputs. This was also the key principle behidn the fire managment 
systems design with interactabke sliders allowing the player to drag to manage the current burn. The hardware limitations also influenced 
the current visual assests and mechanics used, with attempts to prevent future performance issuses.
 

The project is being developed by

- Connor Samra-Dardis: Core Mechanics Programming, Game Design, Ui Mechanics Support<sup>temp</sup> ,Level Development<sup>temp</sup>
- Hayden Clark: Ui Development, Game Design, Ui Programming, Level Development<sup>temp</sup>
- Charlie Bui: UX Research, Level Terrain

### Built With

The Project was developed with Unity 6 (6000.0.040f1LTS) and a Github repositery version control. 
Google Docs was used for the Game Design Doccumentation and GoogleSheets for Project/Sprint Managment.

<!-- How To Play -->
## Controls



To trigger coolburns the player clicks the fire button then clicks the ground item which is a diffrent shade of green allowing the coolburn 
to be initiated. The player then needs to manage the fire using the fire intensity sliders which appear when the player is within range of 
the burning item and the water button is pressed. The slider can then be dragged downwards to lower the intensity of the fire, with when the 
intensity remains low the fire is put out. If unmanaged the fire will spread to nearby vegetation increasing the fire danger rating.

The goal of the scenario 1 is to lower the fire danger rating which can be checked by clicking the phone Ui button.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [ ] CoolBurn Scenario (Scenario 1)
  - [ ] Player Pathfinding Movement - Feature 1
  - [ ] Score System - Feature 2
  - [ ] Weather System - Feature 3
  - [ ] Phone Notfication System - Feature 4


- [ ] Known Issues
  - [ ] Fire Danger Rating Arrow Movement 
  - [ ] Coolburn Intensity Threshold Adjustments
  - [ ] Remake or Adjust Terrain and Enviroment
  - [ ] Change Water Ui Button Icon


- [ ] Wildfire Scenario (Scenario 2)
  - [ ] Wildfire Entity - Feature 1
  - [ ] Firebreaks Stopping Spread - Feature 2

- [ ] Known Issues Not Applicable (Not implmented within Prototype 1)


These are some of the key features that were unable to be implmented prior to prototype submission. Further planned features are outlined within the 
Game Design Documentation which also has the explanation of features.

There are also known issues with the Fire Danger rating and drawing users attention to the phone promot when the fire danger rating updates. 
This build is still an early prototype so the fire intensity growthrate variables and mechanics still need to be finetuned based off playertesting feedback.
