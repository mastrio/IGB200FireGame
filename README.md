<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Counter Fire is a student developed project for the IGB200 assesment submission for the DES project brief. This is the first prototype which is still lacking animations and a second scenario but features majority of the key fire mechanics. 


The project is being developed by 

- Andrew Seton: Project Managment, Assest Moddeler, Assest Managemnt, Level Development<sup>temp</sup>
- Connor Samra-Dardis: Core Mechanics Programming, Game Design, Ui Mechanics Support<sup>temp</sup> ,Level Development<sup>temp</sup>
- Hayden Clark: Ui Development, Game Design, Ui Programming, Level Development<sup>temp</sup>
- Charlie Bui: UX Research, Level Terrain

temp = temporary role for prototype

### Built With

The Project was developed with Unity 6 (6000.0.040f1LTS) and a Github repositery version control. Google Docs was used for the Game Design Doccumentation and GoogleSheets for Project/Sprint Managment.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [ ] CoolBurn Scenario (Scenario 1)
  - [ ] Player Pathfinding Movement - Feature 1
  - [ ] Score System - Feature 2
  - [ ] Weather System - Feature 3
  - [ ] Phone Notfication System - Feature 4


Known Issues
  - [ ] Fire Danger Rating Arrow Movement 
  - [ ] Coolburn Intensity Threshold Adjustments
  - [ ] Remake or Adjust Terrain and Enviroment


- [ ] Wildfire Scenario (Scenario 2)
  - [ ] Wildfire Entity - Feature 1
  - [ ] Firebreaks Stopping Spread - Feature 2

known Issues NA (Not implmented into Prototype 1)


These are some of the key features that were unable to be implmented prior to prototype submission. Further planned features are outlined within the 
Game Design Documentation which also has the explanation of features.

There are also known issues with the Fire Danger rating and drawing users attention to the phone promot when the fire danger rating updates. 
This build is still an early prototype so the fire intensity growthrate variables and mechanics still need to be finetuned based off playertesting feedback.
